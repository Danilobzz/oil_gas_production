U.S. Oil & Gas Production Analysis

This project analyzes U.S. Oil & Gas production data from June 2008 to June 2018. The goal is to explore the dataset and uncover key insights.
Steps

    Download the Dataset: Obtain the U.S._natural_gas_production.csv from Kaggle.
    Create Data Folder: Use mkdir data in the Terminal to create a folder and store the CSV inside.
    Data Exploration: Start with a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis (we'll use VSCode later for scripting).

Tools

    Jupyter Notebook (for exploration)
    VSCode (for final scripts)
    Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

Future Steps

After exploration, we'll develop Python scripts for automation and more advanced data engineering tasks.
